<h2><a id="A_PREFATORY_NOTE"></a>A PREFATORY NOTE</h2>

<p><i>The Lecture&mdash;“Discoveries and Inventions”&mdash;by
our greatest American,
presents a phase of Lincoln’s activity
about which little is generally known.
It shows as clearly as any of his other
writings how great was Lincoln’s
knowledge of the progress of mankind,
particularly as related in the Bible, and
it reveals also his debt to that Book of
Books for inspiration and illustration,
as well as his masterly use of pure
English, largely gained through that
study.</i></p>

<p><i>In the fateful year of 1860, the year
of his election to the presidency, Lincoln
took up, in the pause of his affairs after
the long debate with Douglas, the custom
of lyceum lecturing, then in great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">5</a></span>
vogue. This lecture on “Discoveries and
Inventions” was delivered in towns
near his home, Springfield, Illinois, and
in Springfield itself on Washington’s
birthday. Five days later Lincoln made
his great speech at Cooper Union in
New York.</i></p>

<p><i>The lecture is not included with any
collection of Lincoln’s addresses. It appeared
in print for the first time in <cite class="n">Sunset
Magazine</cite> in 1909&mdash;the centennial
of Lincoln’s birth</i>.</p>

<p><i>The original manuscript, from which
this edition, the first in book form, is
made, was a cherished possession of the
late Dr. Samuel Houston Melvin, of
Oakland, California, formerly a resident
of Springfield, Illinois, and a
friend of Mr. Lincoln. Just prior to
Dr. Melvin’s death, in 1898, he made<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">6</a></span>
an affidavit setting forth the history
of the manuscript; that statement is as
follows</i>:</p>

<blockquote>

<h3 class="center vspace">MEMORANDUM OF<br />
CERTAIN FACTS FOR INFORMATION OF<br />
THOSE WHO FOLLOW AFTER</h3>

<p><i>In the month of February, 1861, being at that
time a resident of Springfield, Illinois, I called one
evening at the residence of my friend, Dr. John Todd.
The doctor was an uncle of Mrs. Abraham Lincoln.
While there Mr. Lincoln came in, bringing with
him a well-filled satchel, remarking as he set it down
that it contained his literary bureau. Mr. Lincoln
remained some fifteen or twenty minutes, conversing
mainly about the details of his prospective trip to
Washington the following week, and told us of the
arrangements agreed upon for the family to follow
him a few days later. When about to leave he handed
the grip above referred to to Mrs. Grimsley, the
only daughter of Dr. Todd, who was then a widow
but who subsequently became the wife of Rev. Dr.
John H. Brown, a Presbyterian minister located in
Springfield, remarking as he did so that he would
leave the bureau in her charge; that if he ever returned
to Springfield he would claim it, but if not
she might make such disposition of its contents as she
deemed proper. A tone of indescribable sadness was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">7</a></span>
noted in the latter part of the sentence. Lincoln had
shown me quite a number of letters a few days before,
threatening his life, some predicting that he
never would be inaugurated, and it was apparent
to me that they were making an impression upon his
mind, although he tried to laugh the matter off.
About five years later the Nation was startled by
the announcement of Lincoln’s assassination. The
corporation of Springfield selected twelve of its citizens
to proceed at once to Washington and accompany
the remains of the dead President back to his
old home. I was one of that number, and shall never
forget the indescribable sadness manifested by millions
of mourners along the route of travel of the
funeral cortège as it wended its way westward over
two thousand miles. A few evenings after his body
was laid to rest, I again called upon my neighbors,
the family of Dr. Todd. Scenes and incidents connected
with the assassination and funeral of the dead
President were discussed, and the remark made by
Lincoln on his last visit to the house was referred
to as indicating a presentiment that he would not
return alive. This recalled the fact of his having
left his so-called literary bureau, and his injunction
as to its disposition. Mrs. Grimsley brought the grip
from the place where it had been stored, and opened
it with a view to examining its contents. Among
them was found this manuscript, and attached to it
by means of a piece of red tape was another of like
character. They proved to be manuscripts of two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">8</a></span>
lectures which he had prepared and delivered within
a year prior to his election to the presidency&mdash;one
at Jacksonville, Illinois, and a few days later at Decatur,
Illinois; the other a little later at Cook’s Hall,
Springfield, Illinois, at which I was present. Mrs.
Grimsley told me to select from the contents of the
bureau any one of the manuscripts it contained; and
supposing at that time that the two manuscripts belonged
to the same lecture, I selected them. On subsequent
examination I discovered that while they
both treated upon the same subject (Inventions and
Discoveries) they were separate lectures. Twenty-five
years later I disposed of one of the manuscripts
to Mr. Gunther<a id="FNanchor_A" href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">A</a> of Chicago. The other it is my hope
and desire shall remain in possession of my family
and its descendants.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>The manuscript is now owned by Dr.
Melvin’s son, the Honorable Henry A.
Melvin, a Justice of the Supreme Court
of California, through whose courtesy
this edition is published.</i></p>

<span class="subhead">A LECTURE BY<br />
ABRAHAM LINCOLN</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap al"><span class="smcap1">All</span> creation is a mine, and every man
a miner.</p>

<p>The whole earth, and all <em>within</em>
it, <em>upon</em> it, and <em>round about</em> it, including
<em>himself</em>, in his physical, moral, and
intellectual nature, and his susceptibilities,
are the infinitely various “leads” from which,
man, from the first, was to dig out his destiny.</p>

<p>In the beginning, the mine was unopened,
and the miner stood <em>naked</em>, and <em>knowledgeless</em>,
upon it.</p>

<p>Fishes, birds, beasts, and creeping things,
are not miners, but <em>feeders</em> and <em>lodgers</em> merely.
Beavers build houses; but they build them in
nowise differently, or better now, than they
did, five thousand years ago. Ants and honey
bees provide food for winter; but just in the
<em>same way</em> they did, when Solomon referred
the sluggard to them as patterns of prudence.</p>

<p>Man is not the only animal who labors;
but he is the only one who <em>improves</em> his
workmanship. This improvement he effects<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">11</a></span>
by <em>Discoveries</em> and <em>Inventions</em>. His first important
discovery was the fact that he was
naked; and his first invention was the fig-leaf
apron. This simple article, the apron, made
of leaves, seems to have been the origin of
<em>clothing</em>&mdash;the one thing for which nearly half
of the toil and care of the human race has
ever since been expended. The most important
improvement ever made in connection
with clothing, was the invention of <em>spinning</em>
and <em>weaving</em>. The spinning jenny, and power
loom, invented in modern times, though
great <em>improvements</em>, do not, <em>as inventions</em>, rank
with the ancient arts of spinning and weaving.
Spinning and weaving brought into
the department of clothing such abundance
and variety of material. Wool, the hair of
several species of animals, hemp, flax, cotton,
silk, and perhaps other articles, were all
suited to it, affording garments not only
adapted to wet and dry, heat and cold, but
also susceptible of high degrees of ornamental
finish. Exactly <em>when</em>, or <em>where</em>, spinning
and weaving originated is not known.
At the first interview of the Almighty with
Adam and Eve, after the fall, He made<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">12</a></span>
“coats of skins, and clothed them” (<cite class="n">Genesis
iii: 21</cite>).</p>

<p>The Bible makes no other allusion to clothing,
<em>before</em> the flood. Soon <em>after</em> the deluge
Noah’s two sons covered him with a <em>garment</em>;
but of what <em>material</em> the garment was
made is not mentioned (<cite class="n">Genesis ix: 23</cite>).</p>

<p>Abraham mentions “<em>thread</em>” in such connection
as to indicate that spinning and weaving
were in use in his day (<cite class="n">Genesis xiv: 23</cite>),
and soon after, reference to the art is frequently
made. “<em>Linen breeches</em>” are mentioned
(<cite class="n">Exodus xxviii: 42</cite>), and it is said “all the
women that were wise-hearted did <em>spin</em> with
their hands” (<cite class="n">Exodus xxxv: 25</cite>), and, “all
the women whose heart stirred them up in
wisdom <em>spun</em> goats’ hair” (<cite class="n">Exodus xxxv: 26</cite>).
The work of the “<em>weaver</em>” is mentioned
(<cite class="n">Exodus xxxv: 35</cite>). In the book of Job, a
very old book, date not exactly known, the
“<em>weavers’ shuttle</em>” is mentioned.</p>

<p>The above mention of “<em>thread</em>” by Abraham
is the oldest recorded allusion to spinning
and weaving; and <em>it</em> was made about two
thousand years after the creation of man, and
now, near four thousand years ago. Profane<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">13</a></span>
authors think these arts originated in Egypt;
and this is not contradicted, or made improbable,
by anything in the Bible; for the allusion
of Abraham, mentioned, was not made
until after he had sojourned in Egypt.</p>

<p>The discovery of the properties of <em>iron</em>,
and the making of <em>iron tools</em>, must have been
among the earliest of important discoveries
and inventions. We can scarcely conceive
the possibility of making much of anything
else, without the use of iron tools. Indeed,
an iron <em>hammer</em> must have been very much
needed to make the <em>first</em> iron hammer with.
A <em>stone</em> probably served as a substitute. How
could the “<em>gopher wood</em>” for the Ark have
been gotten out without an axe? It seems to
me an axe, or a miracle, was indispensable.
Corresponding with the prime necessity for
iron, we find at least one very early notice
of it. Tubal-Cain was “an instructor of every
artificer in <em>brass</em> and <em>iron</em>” (<cite class="n">Genesis iv: 22</cite>).
Tubal-Cain was the seventh in descent from
Adam; and his birth was about one thousand
years before the flood. <em>After</em> the flood, frequent
mention is made of <em>iron</em>, and <em>instruments</em>
made of iron. Thus “instrument of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">14</a></span>
iron” at Numbers xxxv: 16; “bedstead of
iron” at Deuteronomy iii: 11; “the iron furnace”
at Deuteronomy iv: 20, and “iron
tool” at Deuteronomy xxvii: 5. At Deuteronomy
xix: 5, very distinct mention of “the
ax to cut down the tree” is made; and also
at Deuteronomy viii: 9, the promised land
is described as “a land whose stones are iron,
and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass.”
From the somewhat frequent mention of
brass in connection with iron, it is not improbable
that brass&mdash;perhaps what we now
call copper&mdash;was used by the ancients for
some of the same purposes as iron.</p>

<p><em>Transportation</em>&mdash;the removal of person and
goods from place to place&mdash;would be an early
<em>object</em>, if not a <em>necessity</em>, with man. By his
natural powers of locomotion, and without
much assistance from discovery and invention,
he could move himself about with considerable
facility; and even, could carry small
burthens with him. But very soon he would
wish to lessen the labor, while he might, at
the same time, extend, and expedite the business.
For this object, wheel-carriages, and water-crafts&mdash;wagons
and boats&mdash;are the most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">15</a></span>
important inventions. The use of the wheel
and axle has been so long known, that it is difficult,
without reflection, to estimate it at its
true value. The oldest recorded allusion to the
wheel and axle is the mention of a “chariot”
(<cite class="n">Genesis xli: 43</cite>). This was in Egypt, upon
the occasion of Joseph being made governor
by Pharaoh. It was about twenty-five hundred
years after the creation of Adam. That
the chariot then mentioned was a wheel-carriage
drawn by animals is sufficiently
evidenced by the mention of chariot <em>wheels</em>
(<cite class="n">Exodus xiv: 25</cite>), and the mention of chariots
in connection with <em>horses</em> in the same
chapter, verses 9 and 23. So much, at present,
for land transportation.</p>

<p>Now, as to transportation by <em>water</em>, I have
concluded, without sufficient authority perhaps,
to use the term “boat” as a general
name for all water-craft. The boat is indispensable
to navigation. It is not probable
that the philosophical principle upon which
the use of the boat primarily depends&mdash;to-wit,
the <em>principle</em>, that anything will float,
which cannot sink without displacing more
than its own <em>weight</em> of water&mdash;was known,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">16</a></span>
or even thought of, before the first boats were
made. The sight of a crow standing on a
piece of driftwood floating down the swollen
current of a creek or river, might well enough
suggest the specific idea to a savage, that he
could himself get upon a log, or on two logs
tied together, and somehow work his way
to the opposite shore of the same stream.
Such a suggestion, so taken, would be the
birth of navigation; and such, not improbably,
it really was. The leading idea was thus
caught; and whatever came afterwards, were
but improvements upon, and auxiliaries to, it.</p>

<p>As man is a land animal, it might be expected
he would learn to travel by land somewhat
earlier than he would by water. Still
the crossing of streams, somewhat too deep
for wading, would be an early necessity with
him. If we pass by the Ark, which may be
regarded as belonging rather to the <em>miraculous</em>
than to <em>human</em> invention, the first notice
we have of water-craft is the mention of
“ships” by Jacob (<cite class="n">Genesis xlix: 13</cite>). It is not
till we reach the book of Isaiah that we meet
with the mention of “oars” and “sails.”</p>

<p>As man’s <em>food</em>&mdash;his first necessity&mdash;was to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">17</a></span>
be derived from the vegetation of the earth,
it was natural that his first care should be
directed to the assistance of that vegetation.
And accordingly we find that, even before
the fall, the man was put into the garden of
Eden “to dress it, and to keep it.” And when
afterwards, in consequence of the first transgression,
<em>labor</em> was imposed on the race, as a
<em>penalty</em>&mdash;a <em>curse</em>&mdash;we find the first born man&mdash;the
first heir of the curse&mdash;was “a tiller of
the ground.” This was the beginning of agriculture;
and although, both in point of time,
and of importance, it stands at the head of
all branches of human industry, it has derived
less direct advantage from Discovery
and Invention, than almost any other. The
plow, of very early origin; and reaping, and
threshing, machines, of modern invention
are, at this day, the principal improvements
in agriculture. And even the oldest of these,
the plow, could not have been conceived of,
until a precedent conception had been caught,
and put into practice&mdash;I mean the conception,
or idea, of substituting other forces in
nature, for man’s own muscular power. These
other forces, as now used, are principally, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">18</a></span>
<em>strength</em> of animals, and the <em>power</em> of the
wind, of running streams, and of steam.</p>

<p>Climbing upon the back of an animal, and
making it carry us, might not occur very
readily. I think the back of the camel would
never have suggested it. It was, however, a
matter of vast importance. The earliest instance
of it mentioned, is when “Abraham
rose up early in the morning, and saddled his
ass” (<cite class="n">Genesis xxii: 3</cite>), preparatory to sacrificing
Isaac as a burnt-offering; but the allusion
to the <em>saddle</em> indicates that riding had
been in use some time; for it is quite probable
they rode bare-backed awhile, at least,
before they invented saddles.</p>

<p>The <em>idea</em>, being once conceived, of riding
<em>one</em> species of animals, would soon be extended
to others. Accordingly we find that
when the servant of Abraham went in search
of a wife for Isaac, he took ten <em>camels</em> with
him; and, on his return trip, “Rebekah arose,
and her damsels, and they rode upon the
camels, and followed the man” (<cite class="n">Genesis
xxiv: 61</cite>).</p>

<p>The <em>horse</em>, too, as a riding animal, is mentioned
early. The Red Sea being safely passed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">19</a></span>
Moses and the children of Israel sang to the
Lord “the <em>horse</em> and his <em>rider</em> hath he thrown
into the sea” (<cite class="n">Exodus xv: 1</cite>).</p>

<p>Seeing that animals could bear <em>man</em> upon
their backs, it would soon occur that they
could also bear other burthens. Accordingly
we find that Joseph’s brethren, on their first
visit to Egypt, “laded their asses with the
corn, and departed thence” (<cite class="n">Genesis xlii: 26</cite>).</p>

<p>Also it would occur that animals could be
made to <em>draw</em> burthens <em>after</em> them, as well
as to bear them upon their backs; and hence
plows and chariots came into use early enough
to be often mentioned in the books of Moses
(<cite class="n">Deuteronomy xxii: 10</cite>; <cite>Genesis xli: 43</cite>;
<cite class="n">xlvi: 29</cite>; <cite>Exodus xiv: 25</cite>).</p>

<p>Of all the forces of nature, I should think
the <em>wind</em> contains the largest amount of <em>motive
power</em>&mdash;that is, power to move things.
Take any given space of the earth’s surface&mdash;for
instance, Illinois; and all the power exerted
by all the men, and beasts, and running-water,
and steam, over and upon it, shall not
equal the one hundredth part of what is exerted
by the blowing of the wind over and
upon the same space. And yet it has not, so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">20</a></span>
far in the world’s history, become proportionably
<em>valuable</em> as a motive power. It is applied
extensively, and advantageously, to sail-vessels
in navigation. Add to this a few windmills,
and pumps, and you have about all.
That, as yet, no very successful mode of <em>controlling</em>,
and <em>directing</em> the wind, has been discovered;
and that, naturally, it moves by fits
and starts&mdash;now so gently as to scarcely stir a
leaf, and now so roughly as to level a forest&mdash;doubtless
have been the insurmountable difficulties.
As yet, the wind is an <em>untamed</em>, and
<em>unharnessed</em> force; and quite possibly one of
the greatest discoveries hereafter to be made,
will be the taming, and harnessing of it. That
the difficulties of controlling this power are
very great is quite evident by the fact that they
have already been perceived, and struggled
with more than three thousand years; for
that power was applied to sail-vessels, at least
as early as the time of the prophet Isaiah.</p>

<p>In speaking of <em>running streams</em>, as a motive
power, I mean its application to mills and
other machinery by means of the “<em>water
wheel</em>”&mdash;a thing now well known, and extensively
used; but, of which, no mention is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">21</a></span>
made in the Bible, though it is thought to
have been in use among the Romans. (<cite class="n">Am.
Ency.</cite>&mdash;Mill), the language of the Saviour
“Two women shall be grinding at the mill,
etc.” indicates that, even in the populous city
of Jerusalem, at that day, mills were operated
by hand&mdash;having, as yet had no other
than human power applied to them.</p>

<p>The advantageous use of <em>Steam-power</em> is,
unquestionably, a modern discovery. And yet,
as much as two thousand years ago the power
of steam was not only observed, but an ingenious
toy was actually made and put in
motion by it, at Alexandria in Egypt. What
appears strange is, that neither the inventor
of the toy, nor any one else, for so long a
time afterwards, should perceive that steam
would move <em>useful</em> machinery as well as a toy.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
